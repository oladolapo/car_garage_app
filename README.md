We created a Car Garage web application for the admin performing CRUD operations on Vehicles and Mechanics.

- In this application, i may chose my own CSS template to 
design the front end.
- This web application will processed the information of two entities: Car details
and Mechanic details.
- The home page will display the content of both entities one after another.
- This application will give the following provisions to be applied:
To allow the admin to add the car details: id, make, model, colour, 
year, plate number, and fault
o To allow the admin to edit the car details
o To allow the admin to delete the car object
o To allow the admin to add the mechanic’s details: id, full name 
expert domain, and experience (in the number of years)
o To allow the admin to edit the mechanic’s details
o To allow the admin to delete the mechanical object
we used the local storage of the browser to store and process all the 
information.
